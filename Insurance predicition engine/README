# Healthcare Risk Engine: Predictive Cost Modeling

### Overview
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict individual medical insurance costs based on demographic and health factors. It goes beyond simple analysis by deploying the final model as an **interactive web application** that can be run locally or in a Docker container.

**Goal:** Transform raw patient data into an actionable real-time pricing engine.

### Tech Stack
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, Linear Regression), Pandas, NumPy.
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn.
* **Deployment:** Streamlit (Web App), Docker (Containerization).

### Key Results
We compared two models to find the most accurate predictor:

| Model | R² Score (Accuracy) | RMSE (Avg Error) | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linear Regression** | 0.8069 | ~$5,956 | Good baseline, but missed non-linear patterns. |
| **Random Forest** | **0.8798** | **~$4,700** | **Winner.** Captures interactions (e.g., Smoker + High BMI). |

**Top Cost Drivers:**
1.  **Smoker Status:** The #1 predictor of high costs.
2.  **BMI:** High BMI *multiplies* the cost risk for smokers (non-linear relationship).
3.  **Age:** Steady linear increase in base costs.

### How to Run the App
You can run the predictor using **Streamlit** (Local) or **Docker** (Containerized).

#### Option 1: Run Locally
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Launch Web App
streamlit run app.py
3. Open your browser to http://localhost:8501

#### Option 2: Run with Docker
1. Build the image
docker build -t healthcare-app .

2. Run the container
docker run -p 8501:8501 healthcare-app
