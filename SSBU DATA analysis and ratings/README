# Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Elo/Glicko Ranking System

**Project Type:** Collaborative Group Project (3 Members)
**Tools:** Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Mathematical Modeling

###  Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive data collection and ranking system designed to track competitive *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate* performance within a local gaming club.

Developing this system was a **shared effort among three equal contributors**. Over the course of two years, our team collectively managed the data lifecycle—from manual data entry of raw match logs to the implementation of complex statistical formulas for the leaderboard.

###  The Team & Contributions

This project was built through the equal collaboration of 3 team members. Workload was distributed evenly across the following areas:

* 
**Data Engineering:** Co-managed a relational database of **500+ match records**, ensuring consistent logging of stages, stocks, and character matchups.


* **Algorithm Implementation:** Collaboratively researched and implemented Elo and Glicko rating formulas in a spreadsheet environment without external plugins.
* **Quality Assurance:** Shared responsibility for "data hygiene," regularly auditing logs to identify and correct data entry errors to maintain leaderboard integrity.

**Contributors:**

* **Srihari Balaji**
* **Akash Abedin**
* **Aneesh Singh**

### 📊 The Data

We tracked granular match data to ensure the rankings reflected true skill. The dataset includes:

* 
**Match Metadata:** Date, Location (Tournament vs. Local), and Round type.


* 
**Game Variables:** Characters used, Stage selection (e.g., Battlefield, Final Destination), and Winner/Loser identification.


* 
**Performance Metrics:** Stock count remaining, JV (perfect games), and TKOs.

###  The Math (Elo & Glicko Implementation)

Instead of using pre-built libraries, we manually engineered the rating logic using advanced spreadsheet formulas.

**Key Mathematical Parameters:**
We configured specific variables to control the volatility and inflation of the ranking system:

* **Divisor:** `400`
* **K-Factor:** `8` (Determines how much a player's rating changes after a single match)
* **C-Value:** `73.065` (Constant derived to govern the time-based Rating Deviation)
* **Volatility (q):** `0.00576`

**Algorithm Logic:**
The system calculates a new rating () based on the old rating (), the actual score (), and the expected score ():




###  The Results

The system automatically generates a live leaderboard that sorts players by their calculated Rating and displays Win/Loss records and average stock differentials.
