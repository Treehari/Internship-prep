# Cookie Cats: A/B Testing for Mobile Game Retention

### Statistical Analysis of Player Behavior and Gate Placement

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the results of an A/B test for the mobile puzzle game, Cookie Cats, to determine the impact of moving the first "gate"—a point where players are forced to wait or make a purchase—from Level 30 to Level 40. The primary objective is to measure how this change affects player retention at 1-day and 7-day intervals.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains records for 90,189 players who installed the game during the testing period.

* **userid**: A unique identification number for each player.
* **version**: The assigned group: control (`gate_30`) or test (`gate_40`).
* **sum_gamerounds**: The total number of game rounds played within the first 14 days of installation.
* **retention_1**: A boolean indicating if the player returned 1 day after installation.
* **retention_7**: A boolean indicating if the player returned 7 days after installation.

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.11**.
* **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation, cleaning, and statistical calculations.
* **Matplotlib**: For exploratory data visualization and plotting bootstrapping distributions.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning

Initial inspection identified a significant outlier ("Super Whale") who played 49,854 rounds. To ensure statistical accuracy, the data was filtered to include only users with fewer than 3,000 game rounds.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

The users were distributed across the two versions as follows:

* **Gate 30**: 44,699 users.
* **Gate 40**: 45,489 users.

Raw retention rates showed a slight advantage for the Level 30 gate in both 1-day (0.59% difference) and 7-day (0.82% difference) metrics.

### 3. Bootstrapping Analysis

To determine if these small differences were statistically significant rather than the result of chance, a bootstrapping simulation was performed with 500 iterations. This involved repeatedly sampling the dataset with replacement to calculate the distribution of the retention differences between the two groups.

## Key Findings & Verdict

The simulation provided the following probabilities that retention is higher when the gate is at Level 30:

* **Probability for 1-Day Retention**: 95.20%.
* **Probability for 7-Day Retention**: 99.80%.

**Conclusion**: The evidence strongly suggests that 7-day retention is higher when the first gate is encountered earlier at Level 30. To maximize long-term player engagement, the gate should not be moved to Level 40.
