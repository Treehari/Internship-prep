#  Airline Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

###  Overview
This project uses Unsupervised Machine Learning to identify distinct customer groups in an airline loyalty program. By analyzing spending behavior and flight frequency, we segmented the user base into 5 actionable personas for marketing optimization.

**Goal:** Transform raw transactional data into "Customer Personas" to improve retention and targeting.

###  Tech Stack
* **SQL (SQLite):** Feature Engineering (Calculating `Engagement Score` and `Points Efficiency`).
* **Python (Scikit-Learn):** K-Means Clustering, StandardScaler, PCA.
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib/Seaborn for "Elbow Plots" and Cluster Visualization, Tableu for professional charts

###  Key Insights (The 5 Personas)
Using the **Elbow Method**, we determined `k=5` was the optimal number of clusters.

| Segment | Behavior Profile | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The VIP Whales** | Top 1% Balance (537k avg). | Retention (concierge service). |
| **The Road Warriors** | Highest Engagement Score (198). | Upsell (Credit Card upgrades). |
| **The Points Hackers** | High Balance, Low Activity. | Cost Reduction (limit bonus payouts). |
| **The Passive Savers** | Good Balance, Low Activity. | Activation (marketing push). |
| **The Newbies** | Low Balance, Low Activity. | Growth (onboarding offers). |

###  Key Code Snippet (SQL Feature Engineering)
We moved logic *upstream* into the database to improve performance:
```sql
SELECT 
    Balance,
    ("Flight_Trans_12" * 10) + ("Bonus_Trans") AS Overall_Engagement_Score
FROM passengers
WHERE Days_Since_Enroll > 365
